  I decided to build this website with the aim of creating a community <br> 
  for like minded individuals who love food and want to cook but just can't<br> 
  or are too lazy to do so.<br> 
</p>
<p>
  I will teach you step by step from my experience which has been a <br>
  combination of loads of laziness and alot of trying and more laziness.<br>
  I am a foodie and not just a foodie like every Tom, Dick and Harry <br> 
  claims to be but a real one. I happen to be a serial expert at this.<br>
</p>
<p>
   What clarifies for a 'real' foodie? <br>
   Someone who can tell you most ingredients used in a recipe <br>
   by taking just a few bites. <br>
</p>

<P><strong> This is how it all started (look at the kid-yes it's me) lol.</strong>
