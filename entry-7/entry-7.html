 <h1>Preparing your mentality</h1>
 <p>Preparing your mentality is the first step towards starting to cook for the first time. </p>

 <h2>1.Figure out the real reason you’re not cooking </h2>
 <p>You may feel the reason you’re not cooking every day is that you either <br>
  feel that you don’t have time or you feel like you don’t know how to <br>
  cook. For me the real reason I didn't cook for the longest time wasn’t that I <br>
  didn’t have the time, it was that I wasn’t prepared to cook. Before you start <br>
  cooking, you have to first know what you’re going to cook. And then you <br>
  have to buy the ingredients that go into that recipe. These 2 steps take up so <br>
  much mental energy that one just tends to fall back to running away from cooking. <br>
  It’s time for you to address this issue now! </p>

  <h2>2.Address the Issue </h2>
  <p>I think for me it’s just about making a schedule for oneself so now I prepare <br>
     myself in advance, shop accordingly and trust me overcoming this whole fiasco <br>
    has been a very liberating feeling. So start by making a grocery list according to <br>
    the recipes which you’ll make soon enough! </p>

    <h2>3.Start small</h2>
    <p>Let’s take baby steps to get where we want to! If you currently don’t cook at all, <br>
       start off by cooking once per week. You can follow the recipes which I have <br>
       attached later on this website as and when you reach that stage. Over time when <br>
       you feel more comfortable, increase to twice a week, and so on. Don’t just pull <br>
       the trigger and go to booking every single day, that’s just a long shot <br>
       for a beginner. Consistency is the key, too much ambition might hinder that. <br>
    </p> 

    <h2>4.Grow slowly</h2>
    <p>Slowly increase the number of days per week that you’re cooking. I mean <br>
       remember why you landed on this website was to learn how to cook so you did <br>
       have the motivation to cook just not the confidence. Now is your time to conquer, <br>
       hehe maybe a little extreme of my feelings! 
    </p> 

    <h2>5.Start with food that you enjoy</h2>
    <p>I’d suggest that you start off by preparing one of the recipes that I have provided <br>
       or prepare dishes that you enjoy. This would be a good motivation for you to get <br>
       started because trust me your zeal and passion will only come out when you’re <br>
       interested and what better interest than serving your tastebuds? <br>
    </p> 

    <h2>6.Share this with others</h2>
    <p>If you know of other people who are suffering from the I am lazy to cook but I <br>
       really want to problem -share this website with them (and this is not just a <br>
       marketing thing I am doing here) When multiple people get involved in a task <br>
       you’re more encouraged to put in more time and energy towards your newly <br>
       undertaken goal. 

    </p> 

    <p class="last"> I am aware that building a new habit is never easy. That said, by breaking <br>
       it down into a few, smaller, easier-to-achieve steps, I know you can <br>
       succeed. After all, if a hopeless case like me can do it, I’m sure you can <br>
       too. You’ve already shown interest by reaching this far into my website <br>
       which is much more motivation than most people have. So get started, <br>
       I bet you’ll even begin to enjoy it. Let’s go to the next step and create an <br>
       actual Grocery List!
