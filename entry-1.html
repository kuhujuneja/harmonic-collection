<p><em>Egg Rice</em> is a comfort food for me. It is super easy to make. First, cook the rice you'd need.<br> On the other hand, take eggs in proportion to the rice and the quantity of eggs you want.<br> Then break the eggs in a different container, mix it thoroughly and add chopped onion, tomato and any other vegetables of your choice.<br> Add salt, pepper and chilli powder according to taste. Take a pan and add your cooked rice with this mixture in it. <br>Thoroughly stir them together and let them cook till the eggs are fully cooked. <br>The dish is ready, enjoy!
